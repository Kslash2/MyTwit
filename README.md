This application is just a Maven project written in Java which I made for fun.
After making a new Twitter account (I had one before) I wanted to follow a users whose username escapes me. I just couldn't remember it! 
But I remember that he was a follower of another one user which I follow. So instead of scrolling down for hours, I decided to use the API. That's why I love programming.
After doing that, I decided to "improve" the project with some "main" utilities.

## TwitUsers:
this is an abstraction of Twitter4J.User. It has followers and following (Users).
## Messages: 
An easy way to see your messages and send ones.
## Tweets:
Getting the latest tweets from your home and latest tweets from specific user
## Utils: 
In this package you will find main class, ConfigurationBuilder "wrapped" and Save class which let you save almost everything you can do with this application on a file. (Usually you will get a list of something, so this class will save each element of the list in a file you choose).


## Other Info

I decided to use Apache License 2.0 as Twitter4J uses the same License. If you want to give me some suggestion for my code, maybe about refactoring it etc. contact me! I will be happy to listen to you! Have fun!
